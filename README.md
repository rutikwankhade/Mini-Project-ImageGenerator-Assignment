# Mini-Project-ImageGenerator-Assignment-3

**Read these instructions carefully to understand the requirements and functionalities for this project.**

We Learned about using `fetch` in our react application to make our first API Call.<br>
The task for this project is to make a random image generator that shows a random image.

## Functionalities

- Image Area to display image.
- Button to fetch new image on Click.
- Showing a Loader when the image is loading.
 
### Task 1: Project Set Up

- Clone this repo by using [use template](https://github.com/frontbenchHQ/Mini-Project-ImageGenerator-Assignment-3/generate) option with name of repo as `Mini-Project-ImageGenerator-Assignment`.

- Clone your created repo and work on it to push your code.

- Use `githubbox.com` instead of `github.com` in your repository path, to create a synced codesandbox(always in sync with code in your repo). Read more [here](https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing#import-from-github)

### Task 2: Project Requirements

- [ ] Create a Component `ImageDisplay` which has an `img` tag and a loader (Loader can simply be text `Loading....` as well ).
- [ ] Create a button in the `App` Component with text `Get New Image` and import `ImageDisplay` component in it.
- [ ] Checkout the documentation at [https://picsum.photos/](https://picsum.photos/) to know about how to use it for getting  a random image.
- [ ] Use  `fetch`  to make an API call to the `URL` from **picsum** documentation on `Get New Image` Button click.
- [ ] Display Loader/Image accordingly (show loader until image is fetched from api, once image is received, hide loader and show the image).
- [ ] Get first image automatically when your react app is Loaded from picsum api as well.

**NOTE:**

- Use of **class component** is strictly `not allowed`.

### Task 3

- [ ]  Submit the Code Repo Link.
